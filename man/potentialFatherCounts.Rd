\title{Count potential fathers}
\usage{
potentialFatherCounts(dataset, mismatches = 0, VLTMin = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{list: a list structure previously output from
\code{\link{genotPPE}} or \code{\link{phenotPPE}}.}

\item{mismatches}{integer: the maximum allowed number of
mismatching loci between candidate and progeny, before the
candidate is rejected as a potential father.}

\item{VLTMin}{integer: the  minimum number of \sQuote{valid} loci
(loci at which a valid progeny-candidate comparison was possible)
required for a candidate to be considered as a potential father.}
}
\value{
A data frame, containing columns \code{Progeny} (progeny
id), \code{Mother} (id of the progeny's mother) and
\code{potentialFatherCount} (the number of potential fathers found
for the given progeny, given the criteria described above).
}
\description{
Count the number of potential fathers detected for each progeny.
}
\details{
Given the output from \code{\link{genotPPE}} or
\code{\link{phenotPPE}},  \code{potentialFatherCounts} returns,
for each progeny, the number of candidates that are identified as
potential fathers.

To decide whether a given candidate is a potential father to a
given progeny, \code{potentialFatherCounts} uses the quantities
FLCount (the number of loci at which a candidate can provide a
gamete compatible with the progeny) and VLTotal (the number of
loci at which a valid comparison was possible - \sQuote{valid}
loci) that are returned by \code{\link{genotPPE}} or
\code{\link{phenotPPE}}.

For a candidate to be identified as a potential father of a
progeny, there are two criteria to be met:
\enumerate{
\item \code{VLTotal >= max(VLTMin,mismatches+1)},
\item \code{FLCount >= VLTotal-mismatches}.
}
Here, \code{VLTmin} and \code{mismatches} are user-specified
parameters. \code{VLTmin} allows the user to ensure that a
candidate is only considered for potential fatherhood if a
sufficient number of valid loci were available for comparison.
\code{mismatches} allows the user to specify a maximum number of
allowed mismatching loci between progeny and candidate, before
the candidate is rejected as a potential father.  Hence the user
may wish to relax the condition that ALL valid loci must match for
a candidate to be regarded as a potential father to a progeny.

\examples{
## Using the example dataset 'FR_Genotype':
data(FR_Genotype)

## Since we did not load this dataset using inputData(), we must
## first process it with preprocessData() before doing anything
## else:
gData <- preprocessData(FR_Genotype,
                        numLoci=7,
                        ploidy=4,
                        dataType="genotype",
                        dioecious=TRUE,
                        mothersOnly=TRUE)

head(gData)  ## Checked and Cleaned version of FR_Genotype

gPPE <- genotPPE(gData)  ## Perform the exclusion analyses

## Obtain counts of potential fathers of each seedling, allowing a
## single allele mismatch:
pFC <- potentialFatherCounts(gPPE,mismatches=1,VLTMin=2)

## pFC can be viewed or written to file via, e.g. write.csv()
