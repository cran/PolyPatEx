# R/PolyPatEx - Paternity Exclusion in Autopolyploid Species

R functions to perform paternity exclusion via allele matching, in
autopolyploid species having ploidy 4, 6, or 8. The marker data used
can be genotype data (copy numbers known) or 'allelic phenotype' data
(copy numbers not known).  Species considered can be dioecious or
monoecious - if monoecious, selfing and non-selfing can be handled
